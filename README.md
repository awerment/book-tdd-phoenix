# TDD Phoenix - Book follow-along

This repository is the result of (mostly) following along with [German Velasco's](https://www.germanvelasco.com) excellent [TDD Phoenix](https://www.tddphoenix.com) book, test-driving the development of the `chatter` application. Many thanks to him for providing a great resource on Elixir, Phoenix and TDD.

The code contained here is - for the most part - **not** the product of my own thought processes. Where the code contained here diverges from the book, I've tried out some other implementation - most notably I've decided to give the `mix phx.gen.auth` generator a go instead of using [doorman](https://hex.pm/packages/doorman).
